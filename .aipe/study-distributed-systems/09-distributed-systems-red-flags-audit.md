# 09 — Distributed-systems red-flags audit

**Industry name(s):** coordination risk audit / partial-failure review.
**Type:** Project-specific.

This file ranks the actual coordination and partial-failure risks in *this*
repo, by consequence. The honest headline carries through: AptKit is
single-process; the only place these risks can bite is at its external-service
boundaries — cloud APIs and (now) the local Ollama process. The list is short on
purpose — inventing risks for a system that doesn't have them would be the worst
kind of distributed-systems theater. The multi-node sync plane that *would* add
real coordination risk is deferred to `buffr` and out of scope here.

## Zoom out — where the risks concentrate

Every real risk lives at, or just inside, the one network hop. Above it, failures
are ordinary in-process exceptions; the risks here are about what happens when
node B misbehaves and node A has to cope.

## Structure pass — the axis for ranking

Rank by the **failure axis**: for each finding, how bad is the consequence when
the provider boundary misbehaves, and how likely is the trigger? A risk that's
both consequential and easy to hit ranks above a foundational gap that only
matters if the system grows a second node.

## Ranked findings

### R1 — `shouldFallback` defaults to "retry everything" (MEDIUM)

**Evidence:** `packages/providers/fallback/src/fallback-provider.ts:44` —
`this.shouldFallback = options.shouldFallback ?? (() => true)`.

**The risk:** with the default, a *permanent* error (a 400 for a malformed
request, an auth failure from a bad API key) triggers a failover to the next
provider — which will reject it identically. You pay the latency and cost of
trying every provider for an error that no provider can succeed on. For a
two-provider chain that's one wasted call; for a longer chain it's N wasted
calls per request, and it masks the real bug (the malformed request) behind a
generic `ProviderFallbackError`.

**The fix:** inject a `shouldFallback` that classifies — fail over on
429/503/network errors, rethrow immediately on 4xx-except-429. The hook exists
(`:73`); it's just not used with real classification by default.

```
  R1 — the wasted-failover path

  malformed request → p1: 400 → shouldFallback()=true → p2: 400 → ... → all fail
                                       │
                          should have been: 400 → rethrow now (broken everywhere)
```

### R2 — no backoff / no same-provider retry (LOW, by design)

**Evidence:** `fallback-provider.ts:50-86` — the loop moves to the next provider
with zero delay; there is no retry of the *same* provider and no backoff/jitter.

**The risk:** low *today* because AptKit fails *over* (switches nodes) rather
than *back* (retries one), so there's nothing to hammer. The risk is latent: the
moment anyone adds same-provider retry on a transient 429/503 without backoff,
they create a thundering-herd / self-DDoS hazard. Flagged so the gap is named
before someone "helpfully" adds a naive retry.

**The fix when triggered:** exponential backoff + jitter on same-provider retry.
See `02`, Step 5.

### R3 — no explicit timeout at AptKit's layer; worse on the Ollama edges (LOW→MEDIUM for local)

**Evidence:** `packages/providers/anthropic/src/anthropic-provider.ts:28-39`
passes `request.signal` to the SDK but sets no `timeout` or `maxRetries` —
AptKit relies on the provider SDK's defaults. The Ollama edges
(`packages/providers/gemma/src/gemma-provider.ts:201-215`,
`packages/retrieval/src/ollama-embedding-provider.ts:60-75`) use a raw `fetch`
with **no SDK and no default timeout at all** — only the passed `AbortSignal`.

**The risk:** for cloud, the effective deadline is whatever the SDK defaults to,
not something AptKit controls. For the **Ollama edges it's worse**: a local model
that's cold-loading or wedged will hang the `fetch` indefinitely unless the
caller supplies an `AbortSignal`. A 9B model's first token after a cold load can
take many seconds; with no per-call deadline, a RAG run can stall on `embed()`
or `complete()` with no upper bound but `maxTurns`. Fine for a hand-run CLI; a
real problem for any unattended or latency-sensitive caller.

**The fix when triggered:** pass an explicit `timeout` into the SDK client for
cloud; wrap the Ollama `fetch` with `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` (or pass one from
the caller) so a cold/wedged local model can't hang the run.

### R4 — `AbortError` detection is duck-typed by name (LOW)

**Evidence:** `fallback-provider.ts:92-95` and `run-agent-loop.ts:219` detect
cancellation via `error.name === 'AbortError'` (and `instanceof DOMException`).

**The risk:** correctness of the "cancellation wins over failover" rule (the
load-bearing detail from `02`/`03`) depends on the error *name* string. A
provider SDK that throws a cancellation error with a different `name` would
slip through, get classified as a normal failure, and trigger an *unwanted
failover* on a request the caller already aborted. Low likelihood (the SDKs use
standard `AbortError`), but the correctness of the abort path rests on a string
match.

**The fix when triggered:** check the signal's `aborted` state directly
(already done partially at `fallback-provider.ts:65` via
`request.signal?.aborted`) rather than relying solely on the error name.

### R5 — usage-ledger pricing covers only `gpt-4.1-*` (INFORMATIONAL)

**Evidence:** `packages/runtime/src/usage-ledger.ts:71-78` —
`pricingForModel` returns `undefined` for any non-OpenAI provider and any model
outside the `gpt-4.1` family (including all Anthropic models).

**The risk:** not a coordination risk — a cost-observability gap. The "accounting
across calls" analog (the closest thing to tracking work across nodes, `03`)
silently reports `n/a` cost for Anthropic-served turns. Token counts are still
summed correctly; only the dollar estimate is missing. Flagged because cost
tracking is fallacy #7 ("transport cost is zero" is false) and the ledger is
where AptKit answers it — incompletely.

**The fix:** add Anthropic pricing rows to `pricingForModel`.

### R6 — embedding-dimension mismatch is a corpus-wide one-way door (LOW, handled well)

**Evidence:** `packages/retrieval/src/pipeline.ts:22-29` (`assertWiring`) throws a
`dimension mismatch` error at pipeline-construction time if the embedder's
dimension (`OllamaEmbeddingProvider` is fixed at 768,
`ollama-embedding-provider.ts:40`) disagrees with the store's.

**The risk:** the *consequence* is large but the *handling* is good. A corpus
indexed at one dimension can only be queried by a same-dimension provider —
swap the embedding model and every stored vector is unsearchable until you
re-index. That's a data-migration coordination problem in disguise (it's exactly
the kind of "schema change forces a backfill" risk that bites replicated stores).
AptKit defuses it correctly: it checks at *wiring time* and throws loudly, so you
can never silently index unsearchable vectors. Listed not as a bug but as the
one place where a model choice is a one-way door over indexed data — and a
forward-looking flag for when `InMemoryVectorStore` becomes a persistent
`PgVectorStore` (in `buffr`), where re-indexing isn't a free in-memory rebuild.

**The fix when triggered:** treat re-index as a first-class operation; version
the corpus by embedding model so a dimension change triggers a backfill rather
than a silent empty-result regression.

### R7 — memory's id counter is in-process; durable store + restart = id collision (LOW today, INFERENCE)

**Evidence:** `packages/memory/src/conversation-memory.ts:71,78-79` — ids are
minted from a per-conversation counter `Map` held in process:
`const n = counters.get(turn.conversationId) ?? 0; ... id = \`${kind}:${turn.conversationId}:${n}\``.
The counter is rebuilt empty on every process start.

**The risk:** the id-uniqueness invariant rests entirely on a single,
never-restarted process owning the counter. The store is injected
(`:18-31,60-61`), and with the durable `PgVectorStore` (in `buffr`,
`/Users/rein/Public/buffr/src/pg-vector-store.ts`) the rows outlive the process
while the counter does not. **Inference:** resume the *same* `conversationId`
after a restart and `remember` mints `memory:<convId>:0` again, and
`store.upsert` (`:80-86`) **overwrites the persisted turn 0** — the earlier
exchange is silently lost. This cannot bite in aptkit today: aptkit only wires
`InMemoryVectorStore` (`conversation-memory.test.ts:27`), where the counter and
the rows die together, so the id space resets cleanly. It's flagged as a
forward-looking correctness hazard for the durable wiring in `buffr`.

```
  R7 — counter resets, durable rows don't (inference)

  before restart:  remember c1 → memory:c1:0, memory:c1:1  (persisted in pg)
  ── restart ──     counter Map emptied; pg rows survive
  after restart:   remember c1 → memory:c1:0  → UPSERT overwrites original turn 0
```

**The fix when triggered:** don't derive ids from in-process state. Either count
existing rows for the conversation in the store before assigning `n`, or use a
content hash / uuid id so the id never depends on a counter that a restart can
reset. (The narrower contract gap: the `VectorStore`
contract — `packages/retrieval/src/contracts.ts:33-37` — has no "next sequence"
primitive, so the engine can't ask the store for a safe `n` today.)

## The non-findings — deliberately absent

These are the risks a checklist would expect that AptKit *correctly* doesn't
have, because it's single-process. Naming them as non-findings is the honest
audit:

```
  Non-findings — risks that DON'T apply (and why)

  split-brain          ── no leader election → impossible
  stale reads          ── no replicas/cache  → one copy of all state
  lost messages        ── no queue           → synchronous, no delivery to lose
  poison messages      ── no durable queue   → no redelivery loop
  quorum failure       ── no replicas        → nothing to count a majority of
  clock skew bugs      ── one process clock   → timestamps are a valid total order
  saga stranded state  ── read-only tools    → no side effect to compensate
  outbox dual-write    ── no DB + no broker   → no atomic write+publish to bungle
```

## Ranked summary

```
  Risk register — by consequence × likelihood

  R1  shouldFallback default = retry-all      MEDIUM   fallback-provider.ts:44
  R2  no backoff / same-provider retry         LOW*     fallback-provider.ts:50-86
  R3  no timeout (cloud) / none at all (Ollama) LOW→MED  ollama-embedding-provider.ts:60-75
  R4  AbortError detected by name string       LOW      fallback-provider.ts:92-95
  R5  ledger pricing OpenAI-gpt-4.1 only       INFO     usage-ledger.ts:71-78
  R6  embedding-dim one-way door (handled well) LOW      pipeline.ts:22-29
  R7  memory id counter ephemeral (durable→collide) LOW† conversation-memory.ts:71

  * LOW today; becomes MEDIUM the instant same-provider retry is added.
  R3 is LOW for cloud (SDK default) but MEDIUM for the Ollama edges (no timeout).
  † LOW + inference: harmless with the in-memory store (the only one aptkit
    wires); becomes a real id-collision bug if a durable PgVectorStore (buffr)
    resumes the same conversation after a restart.
```

The verdict: **for a single-process library, the partial-failure handling at the
external-service boundaries is sound.** The fallback chain, fail-fast guard,
bounded loop, retry-on-parse, and abort passthrough are the right primitives. R1
is the one finding worth acting on now (inject real error classification); R3 on
the Ollama edges (no timeout) is the next. R7 (the memory id counter) is the most
interesting *new* entry: it's harmless in aptkit but is exactly the kind of
single-process assumption that breaks when state goes durable — worth fixing
*before* the `buffr` durable wiring lands, not after. The rest are latent gaps
whose triggers are clearly named — and most of the distributed-systems checklist
correctly doesn't apply, because the system is one process talking to external
services, not a multi-node system. The coordination plane that would change that
verdict is deferred to `buffr`.

## Interview defense

**Q: "What's the biggest distributed-systems risk in this codebase?"**

"R1 — the fallback chain's `shouldFallback` defaults to retrying on *any* error,
including permanent ones like a 400. So a malformed request fails over to every
provider and fails identically, wasting cost and masking the real bug. The fix is
injecting real error classification — fail over on transient errors, rethrow on
permanent ones. The hook exists; it's just defaulted to 'retry everything.'"

```
  default shouldFallback = () => true  →  400 retried on every provider
  fix: classify — transient → next, permanent → rethrow now
```

**Q: "What distributed-systems problems does this system NOT have, and why?"**

"Split-brain, stale reads, lost messages, quorum failures — none of them, because
it's single-process. One copy of all state, one clock, no queue, no replicas, no
leader. The discipline is to handle the one real edge — the provider call — well,
and not bolt on machinery for failures that can't occur."

## Validate

1. **Reconstruct:** List the seven findings ranked, with the one that's
   actionable today — and name which one is an inference that can't bite aptkit
   as-shipped.
2. **Explain:** Why is R1 (`fallback-provider.ts:44`) a real cost/latency risk
   even though the chain "works"?
3. **Apply:** A teammate adds same-provider retry to handle 429s. Which finding
   jumps from LOW to MEDIUM, and what must they add alongside it?
4. **Defend:** Justify why split-brain and stale reads are non-findings here —
   tie each to a specific design fact about the repo.
